# React Todo Example

This is a simple React todo app that runs entirely in your browser.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser **or** run a small local server:
   ```
   npx serve
   # or
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then visit the shown URL (e.g. http://localhost:8000).

The app keeps a unique user ID in `localStorage` and stores your todos in IndexedDB. Drag images onto the content area to embed them.
